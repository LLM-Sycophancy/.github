## Organization-wise note:

27 Jun 2025
- In the current stage, for any promising approach, I will fork one repository, and then create another repository with the same content. The forked one is only for reading and learning, not for writing (I have disabled 'write'). The created duplicate repository is for experimenting, where I will maintain a 'main' branch, while everyone is able (and encouraged) to create your own branch (recommended branch name: your first name). Please try all experimental coding in your own branch.
- At least for now, by default, please do not try to merge/squash your commits to the 'main' branch.
- In later stages, I will activate (already prepared) a branch protection rule, in the sense that one can only merge after PR, but one's PR will need to be first reviewed and approved by two other members.
- More details to come, and I will attach some links to introductions to Git.
